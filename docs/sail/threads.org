* Core Thread Behavior (prototype)
** Main Thread
- spawn first record thread
  - create thread; load record mgr code
  - request window handle from render thread
  - supply handle to thread env
  - supply render thread queue target to thread env
  - (thread presumed running)
- loop, await input
  - permit meta-input
    - allow window (thus thread / proto-record) creation
    - allow window resizing / repositioning
    - handle by sending messages to render thread
  - pass along drawing input
    - pass record-relevant input symbols to correct thread
    - probably need to know which window is active
    - pass local cursor position to active window (?)
    - alt: send inputs to rndr and let it pass them (eh..)
  - run commands
    - accept directives from stdin as currently
    - evaluate and return result

** Render Thread
- loop, await input
  - may receive window request
    - create new window and return handle
  - may receive window instructions
    - resize or move target window
  - may receive draw commands
    - add line to list in target window
  - may receive redraw instruction
    - redraw full frame from graphical state

** Record Thread (*)
- receive window handle
- track step, line / rect mode (?) (track by edit mode?)
- loop, await input
  - receive control input (add point, change step)
    - change state or send draw command to render thread
    - include window handle with draw command
